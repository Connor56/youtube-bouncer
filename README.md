# YouTube Bouncer

A Chrome Extension that helps you stay productive by redirecting you away from distracting YouTube content.

# Features

- Automatically detects YouTube video titles and channel names that match your configured filters
- Redirects you away from videos and channels you've identified as time-wasters
- Simple JSON configuration to specify which content to avoid
- Works seamlessly in the background while browsing YouTube

# How It Works

The extension monitors YouTube video pages and checks the video title and channel name against your configured filters. When it detects content you've marked as distracting, it automatically redirects you away from that page, helping you maintain focus and avoid falling into unproductive viewing patterns.
